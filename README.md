How to get this running:

1. Fork repo    
2. Inside directory, open up terminal and type npm install (requires nodejs downloaded)  
3. Get eslint by typing "npm install -g eslint"  
4. Before every commit, run eslint on your files to make sure they adhere to coding standards using "eslint app.js." If nothing is returned, then you are good to commit!  
5. Run app with "npm start"  



ToDo:
* Make database logins, session key, and other private data into environment variables    
* Remove EJS from project dependencies  
* Client-side validation for valid email and usernames
